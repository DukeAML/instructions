# instructions
This document contains instructions on how to use and navigate DAML's GitHub organization. If you have any questions about setting up a team or repository, contact Jamila Otieno at <jamila.otieno@duke.edu>

## Teams
The DAML GitHub organization is divided into parent and child teams. The main parent teams for this school year are "data science," "hardware," and "software," under which you will find child teams that correlate with each project.
### Finding your team
1. To find your team, navigate to the DukeAML organization dashboard/homepage.
2. Select the "Teams" tab in the menu bar.
3. Scroll down on the page. You should see a list of team names, one of which is the the current school year. Select its caret icon (v) on the right.
4. You should now see a list of teams that resemble the DAML divisions. Select the caret icon for your division to see all of its projects/child teams.
5. Select your team from the list (should be in alphabetical order).
6. You should now see the dashboard for your project where you'll be able to find your team's repositories, members, discussions, etc.

### Adding a new team
In the event that we add new projects to DAML, you may need to create new teams.
1. Navigate to the DukeAML organization dashboard/homepage.
2. Select the "Teams" tab in the menu bar.
3. Navigate to the dashboard of parent team. *E.g. If you're trying to add a team for a new data science project for Spring 2021, go to the data science child team under the 2020 - 2021 parent team.*
4. Select the "Teams" tab in the menu bar of the parent team and scroll down. You should see all the current child teams for that particular parent.
5. Click the green "Add a team" button. 
6. Type in the name of the new team and click the "TEAM-NAME (create team)" dropdown button.
7. You should see the "Create new team" page. Check to make sure the team name and parent team options are correct. Feel free to add a description if you'd like. The "Team visibility" option should be set to "Visible."
8. Select the green "Create team" button.
9. You should now be able to find the new team you've created under its parent.

## Repositories
All project teams should access their repositories through the team's dashboard. Use the instructions below to learn how to create a new repository for your team or to transfer an existing repository to your team's profile.

### Setting up a new repository
1. To create a new repository, navigate to the DukeAML organization dashboard/homepage.
2. Select the "Repositories" tab and click on the green "New" button on the right side of the screen.
3. Give your repo a descriptive name (probably just the team name).
4. If your project is open source and/or there are no privacy/NDA concerns, select "public" for the repository type. Otherwise, select "private" to prevent non-approved parties from viewing the repository.
5. Initialize the repository with any files (e.g. README) or licenses you may want, and select the green "Create Repository" button at the bottom of the screen.
6. Once you've created the repository, you should see the normal repository dashboard with a card at the top that says "Give access to the people you work with." Click on the green "Add teams and collaborators" button. This should take you to your repository's "Manage access" settings page. If you did not see the card at the top, navigate to your repository's "Settings" page and select "Manage access" from the menu bar on the left side of the screen.
7. Select the green "Invite teams or people" button in the middle of the screen.
8. Search for your team by name. You should see a dropdown option that looks something like "DukeAML/TEAM-NAME." Select your team, choose the "Write" role, and click the green "Add DukeAML/TEAM-NAME to this repository" button.
9. You should now be able to see your repository under your team.

### Adding an existing repository
1. To add an existing repository to the DukeAML organization, you'll need to have admin privileges for the original repository.
2. Navigate to the existing repository's dashboard and go the "Settings" page. You should see the "Options" heading selected on the menu bar on the left side. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the "Danger Zone."
4. Find the "Transfer ownership" card and select the red "Transfer" button. 
5. Type "DukeAML" for the "New owner's GitHub username or organization name" input.
6. Type in the confirmation text and select the red "I understand, transfer this repository." button. 
7. You should see a page with the title "Team access" which should list all the teams under the DukeAML GitHub organization. Scroll through the options (should be in alphabetical order) to find your team's name and select **your team only!** Do not select any other teams.
8. Select the green "Transfer" button on the bottom of the page.
9. In a few minutes, you should be able to see your repository under your team in the DAML GitHub organization.
